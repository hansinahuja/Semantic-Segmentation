# Instructions

Follow these instructions to use `./../src/predict.py`:
1. Download all the model checkpoints from [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x40ACWvt750NQoHh8L-6AKtlcI0SN_qT?usp=sharing) If the only purpose is to run the prediction file, only `model.h5` needs to be downloaded.
2. Upload the downloaded files in the current directory.
3. Running the file on a local system might throw an error due to a mismatch between the latest version of Keras and the version that TensorFlow uses. An update of the libraries solves this issue.
